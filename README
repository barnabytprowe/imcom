---IMCOM v0.2.X --- Barnaby Rowe & Christopher Hirata (2010-11) ---

Within this package please see imcom_documentation.pdf for some (very) light 
documentation describing how to use this early, prototype version (v0.2.X) of 
the IMCOM IMage COMbination software described in Rowe, Hirata \& Rhodes 
(2011). This document, a practical introduction to IMCOM, can be found within 
the ./releases/ subdirectory, which is simply there to gather tarballs together 
for people not using Hg!

For theoretical details and discussion of the precise implementation that 
we follow, please see the IMCOM paper.
