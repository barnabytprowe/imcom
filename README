---IMCOM v0.2.X --- Barnaby Rowe & Christopher Hirata (2010-11) ---

Within this package please see imcom_documentation.pdf for some (very) light 
documentation describing how to use this early, prototype version (v0.2.X) of 
the IMCOM IMage COMbination software described in Rowe, Hirata \& Rhodes 
(2011). This document, a practical introduction to IMCOM, can be found within 
the individual ./releases/ subdirectories.

This releases directory is simply there to gather tarballs together for 
people not using Hg! However, that directory is a good place to look for 
simple generic Makefiles, example files etc.  The root directory for the
repository is Barney's working directory, and so contains his machine specific
Makefile.

For theoretical details and discussion of the precise implementation that 
we follow, please see the IMCOM paper.

General queries may be directed towards browe@star.ucl.ac.uk.

NOTE: There is currently something slightly wrong in the example images - this
will be attended to ASAP!
